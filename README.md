# Wireless Software Systems Architecture - Fall 2019

Lab 2: 
In this lab we are tasked with familiarizing ourselves with the tools and techniques for developing software for wireless embedded systems. The objectives of this lab are in learning to work with the PowerDue, a custom arduino module, and ultimately learn to appreciate the synergy between these software and hardware platforms. Working with on-board components through corresponding software libraries and finally getting accustomed with FreeRTOS, which is a real-time operating system kernel for embedded devices, using the provided libraries in Arduino IDE.

Lab 3:
In this we expand on our knowledge from Lab 1 working with the PowerDue, a custom arduino module, and ultimately learn and analyze commonly used protocols for serial communication in embedded systems. Specifically, we learn how we can use PowerDue and use the protocols I2C to communicate with the SparkFun LSM303C IMU whichis a Inertial Measurement Unit breakout board. For the second part, we interfaced the PowerDue to the FXOS8700CQ magnetometer using the SPI protocol, which is part of the BRKT-STBC-AGM01 breakout board. In this lab we learned how to implement each protocol in the context of reading magnetometer sensor data.
