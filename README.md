# Lab 2 for Wireless Software Systems Architecture - Fall 2019
In this lab we are tasked with familiarizing ourselves with the tools and techniques for developing software for wireless embedded systems. The objectives of this lab are in learning to work with the PowerDue, a custom arduino module, and ultimately learn to appreciate the synergy between these software and hardware platforms. Working with on-board components through corresponding software libraries and finally getting accustomed with FreeRTOS, which is a real-time operating system kernel for embedded devices, using the provided libraries in Arduino IDE.
